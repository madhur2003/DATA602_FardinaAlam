I am interested in taking DATA602 because it gives me the idea how of how data science works and how it is used in real life. In the last two classes that I have had the opportunity to attend, I had the chance to start learning about it and I started gaining a lot of knowledge that I had no idea about. This course will help me have a better understanding of the skills required to develop and make a good future for myself in data science.
